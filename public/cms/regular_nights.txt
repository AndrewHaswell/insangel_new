<p>Every Tuesday from 8pm at The Three Tuns is<strong> 'Insangel Introducing'..</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'foot in the door' gig with Insangel. Specific Gig Details at further down the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>REASON</strong></h2>
<p>Insangel has been running grassroots gigs since 1996, and because of that has gained the confidence&nbsp;from venues to book and provide them with regular live music.&nbsp;With this faith that&nbsp;the&nbsp;venues have with the 'BUSINESS', it is paramount that&nbsp;Insangel has seen first hand (as in LIVE) the band or musicians wanting to perform at these shows.&nbsp;I know there are&nbsp;bands that have&nbsp;been around for years&nbsp;or that are professional and feel a&nbsp;showcase (or audition) is above them, that's fine! but, please just respect how i&nbsp;work and it's just unfortunate that i'm not familier with you or your band and we just can't move on any further without&nbsp;playing this&nbsp;initial show. If i'm familier with you or have seen you elsewhere I will get in touch with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>FORMAT</strong></h2>
<p>So once we've booked in the&nbsp;gig, the format is 'usually' as follows; depending on people arriving on time and turning up. There's no 'headliners' in this show, the order is booked based on as and when the slots have been taken working backwards from the last slot.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>630pm Load IN</em></li>
<li><em>645-655 Last Band Souncheck</em></li>
<li><em>705-715 Second Last Band Soundcheck</em></li>
<li><em>725-735 Second Band Soundcheck</em></li>
<li><em>745-755 First Band Soundcheck</em></li>
<li><em>8-830 First Band</em></li>
<li><em>845-915 Second Band</em></li>
<li><em>930-1000 Second Last Band</em></li>
<li><em>1015-1045 Last Band</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></h2>
<p>We will provide a basic&nbsp;skelton drum kit with house stands, all drummers 'need' is snare drum, cymbals and sticks. However i would recommednd bring hardware if you can and kick pedal. It's a well used 'house kit' so it may not be the quality you're used too. We will provide all the PA, Microphones, Cables, Mic Stands and also an Engineer for your sound needs and requirements.</p>
<p>There are house combo amps, i would not advise using them but are fine if you're stuck. You will need all amps, cabs, pedals etc - any problems make arrangements with the other bands to share but dont just turn&nbsp;up expecting to use someone else's gear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PAYMENT &amp; PROMOTION</strong></h2>
<p>No money changes hands this evening, the venue pay for the PA and Engineer and we keep it FREE ENTRY,&nbsp;There are also no free drinks&nbsp;unfortunatly. If you are&nbsp;a band that make&nbsp;a good impression and have done some groundwork to have&nbsp;a good turn out,&nbsp;Insangel will find the shows that pay, offer the bigger support slots, agree fees and do the proper promotion of&nbsp;the event.</p>
<p>Because of the amount of events Insangel book,&nbsp;there&nbsp;won't be a facebook event every week. Facebook have blocked and banned&nbsp;Insangel for making too many in the past, so these are saved also for the special events. You are more than welcome and supported to make your own and i will share, i can also link the gig guide to the event. Keep an eye&nbsp;on the gig guide for the other artists added to your line up. Also all artists listed, the website will generate an 'Artist Page' here on the site with all the shows you are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this page as productive as we can please email phil@insangel.co.uk the following;</p>

<p>This is a great gig in a world famous and internationally touring band venue, so make the most of it be memorable for the right reasons and more importantly support the other bands, arrive early and stay late and put some money behind the bar to keep venues alive.</p>
